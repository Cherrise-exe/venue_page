<h1>Venue Page Project</h1>
<p>This react app project was created for a fictional music festival that the team named Barclays Bash. Our team used various react libraries and components such as the FullCalender component to implement a calender that will display the events happening at the Barclays Center. We also made the user experience more interactive by including an aerial view of the stadium. We used CSS to make the user interface reminiscent of a night-time concert.</p>

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
